	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Hi! My name is Paige and I'm a senior program manager at JFF, a national workforce and education intermediary.</p>
	<p font size="1em" font color="gray">I specialize in synthesizing data and translating user needs to design and automate processes. I currently lead JFF's internal Salesforce strategy team, having designed several sales and marketing automation process. I independently launched and managed an annual survey to gather data on the populations, industries, and stakeholders JFF engages, and I was the program manager for JFFLabs' inaugural Work-Based Learning Cohort, which received over 60 applications. Colleagues consider me a collaborative and approachable leader with strong writing skills.</p>
	<p font size="1em" font-color="blue">Prior to joining JFF, I was a 2013 Venture for America (VFA) fellow and worked in product development at Vorbeck Materials and Graphene Frontiers. I also served as the VFA community liaison in Philadelphia, where I helped build relationships between VFA fellows and local entrepreneurs, investors, and community groups. As an engineer, I invented two wearable electronics devices, US Patents #10,169,978 and #10,067,008, and my work has been published at conferences including The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society and the American Society for Mechanical Engineers. I earned my master's degree in business administration at MIT Sloan School of Management and my bachelor's degree in materials engineering from Johns Hopkins University.</p>
	<p font size="1em" font-color="gray">I am currently the Americana Music Director at WMBR, and I co-host FM Road, an Americana and country show, on Saturdays from 8 to 10am.</p>
	<p font size="12px" font-color="gray">In my spare time, you'll most often find me running, reading, or taking an art class.</p>
